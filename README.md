# Projet_Innovation

In this project we are trying to set up a facial recognition system to detect absences.
As far as the technical aspect is concerned, we relied on a Microservices-oriented architecture. On a JEE platform,
Spring Boot was used as the Backend and Middleware, and Thymeleaf as the template engine in the Frontend.
